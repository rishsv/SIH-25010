## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
Most small and marginal farmers in India depend on outdated knowledge, local vendors, or guesswork for vital decisions such as crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer application. This results in low yields, inflated input costs, and excessive chemical use, which harms both the environment and farmer livelihoods. Limited access to personalized, data-driven advisory services—alongside language barriers and low digital literacy—prevents them from leveraging modern agriculture technologies for better results.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Small farmers need scientific, personalized guidance to boost productivity, cut costs, and raise their standard of living. A smart advisory solution not only supports these aims but also encourages sustainable agriculture and food security. If delivered in the local language and adapted for limited digital skills, such a solution can drive significant positive change and lessen farmers’ reliance on unreliable third-party sources.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Problem Creater's Organization
Government of Punjab

## Theme
Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
This solution combines AI, language technologies, and mobile development to offer personalized crop advice via an app and chatbot. By integrating soil analysis, weather data, crop history, and local market prices, the system provides actionable insights tailored to the user’s needs. The application uses voice input, local languages, and intuitive interfaces to ensure accessibility for low-literate farmers. Image-based pest and disease detection leverages computer vision, while the backend continuously learns from feedback to improve recommendations.

## Technical Approach
Technologies: Python, Android (Kotlin/Java), machine learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch), natural language processing, cloud platforms (AWS/GCP), and GIS tools for location analysis.
Hardware: Smartphones, optional external soil sensors, basic camera modules for image input.
Methodology:
Collect soil, crop, and location data.
Analyze data via AI models for personalized recommendations.
Implement user-friendly mobile interfaces supporting local languages and voice.
Develop image analysis tools for pest detection.
Use feedback and analytics for iterative improvement.


## Feasibility and Viability
Feasibility: Widespread smartphone usage and increasing familiarity with mobile apps among rural populations make implementation practical. AI and cloud technologies provide scalable and affordable infrastructure.
Challenges: Limited internet access in remote areas, ensuring model accuracy with diverse crop data, and overcoming language barriers.
Risk Mitigation: Offline mode support, continual dataset expansion, and community training workshops can address these issues.

## Impact and Benefits
Potential Impact: Empowers farmers with scientific knowledge, resulting in higher yields and lower costs. Reduces environmental impact via optimal chemical use.
Benefits: Promotes social equity, economic growth, and sustainable development in rural India.
